# MPI-Programing-Basics
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed to function on parallel computing architectures. 
The MPI standard defines the syntax and semantics of library routines that are useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in C, C++, and Fortran.
This repository contain basic operation we practice when doing MPI programming using C. All the C files, make files and host files are included.
Once you install MPICH on your machine just download this repository and you can test your own.
